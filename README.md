in this repo we would be able to see if we are using fractional cpu and memory assigned for our instance how would we get proper info inside the application and how to calculate in percentage properly so that we can scale up or down our processing without killing the pod. 
This repo will help u to understand how much load u can put with the limited pod resouce and you would be able to control how much thing you might want to process at a time depending on these values.
